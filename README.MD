# LargeBuffers
A simple library to allow Java programs to create buffers larger than 2^31 bytes in size. The current maximum supported size is 2^64, although that is untested at this time.

# NOTE
This is not ready for wide use, only tested on a single x86_64 linux computer!

Natives are not done for all platforms at this time!
